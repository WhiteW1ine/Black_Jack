The program is started by running the App class.

The 2 bugs that were found in the model/game.java class when handing in grade 2, were fixed using the clone functionality to avoid unnecessary exposure.

### Completion Needed
All fixes mentioned in the grade 3 completion needed feedback have been implemented. The fixes for Grade 2 are not implemented in the Grade 3 version.

The visitor implementation was modified to have all rules in one interface and one class in the view that implements the visitor interface. A class that prints all visitor related output in Swedish was added.
For the view refactoring the view interface was re-added and the abstract class was used as a base class.
